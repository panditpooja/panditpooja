# Hello, I'm Pooja Pandit 👋
## "Empowering Innovation through Data: Computer Engineer | Data Enthusiast | Problem Solver"
### Welcome to my GitHub. Here's a little bit about myself...
- 👋 Hi, I’m a passionate Data Enthusiast.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative data engineering projects, especially those that involve building scalable and efficient data pipelines and ETL processes.
  - 🛠️👨‍💻 You can find various data-driven engineering projects on my github profile.
  - 📊🔍 Developing insightful data visualizations and dashboards to help drive business decisions.
  - 📈🤖 Innovative data science projects, especially those involving machine learning and predictive analytics.
- 📫 Here's How to reach me: 1. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pooja-pandit-177978135/).
  2. [Topmate](https://topmate.io/pooja_pandit)
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Interesting fact:  My former clients extended an invitation for me to join them at their onsite office in Amsterdam, Netherlands. So I traveled from Mumbai to Amsterdam to further enhance my skills and collaborate directly with clients, not only strengthening client relationships but also gaining invaluable hands-on experience working in a dynamic international environment. 
 🌍✈️
